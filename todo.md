# To Do #

1. Automatically exit PixivUtil2 after running it.
1. Send the output to a file. Right now it crashes when I try.
   1. Maybe even a file and the console.
1. Rwwrite everything with a better language.
   1. The batch file will literally just call `python myScript` with all the command line args passed through.
   1. Or whatever language I coose. Not necessarily python.
